# passm

Simple tool to manage my password creation/edition workflow

In a nutshell, `passm` is a wrapper over
[pass](http://passwordstore.org) with the added feature of syncing
passwords to and from [LastPass](https://lastpass.com)

## Why would I want to use LastPass if I am already using pass?

Simply put, there is no `pass` on iOS unless jailbroken (and even
with that, the app hasn't been updated in ages). I'll go back to
Android as soon as I can, but for the time being this will do.
